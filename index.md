### Quickstart in Script-Fu - GIMP 2.10.30

* Create a local directory as a sandbox for new scripts. Add that directory in
Gimp as a scripts folder.
\
Restart Gimp, any scripts in that new folder should appear as menu items or
useable procedures.\
*Gimp->Edit->Preferences->Folders->Scripts (add new folder)*

* After editing and saving a script, I press the "#" key in Gimp,
set up as a keyboard shortcut. I use "sublime" as a syntax highlighting editor. 
\
*Gimp->Edit->Keyboard Shortcuts (Refresh Scripts)*

* Keep the Error Console window open. It's the only way I've been able to find
to debug a script.\
*Gimp->Windows->Dockable Dialogues->Error Console*

* Scripts copied from the blog posts should be saved as the same name as the
define name.For example, a script defined as *bareBones* would be saved as
*bareBones.scm* in a scripts folder.
