### Quickstart in Script-Fu - GIMP 2.10.30

* Create a local directory as a sandbox for new scripts. Add that directory in
Gimp as a scripts folder.
\
Restart Gimp, any scripts in that new folder should appear as menu items or
useable procedures.\
*Gimp->Edit->Preferences->Folders->Scripts (add new folder)*

* After editing and saving a script, I press the "#" key in Gimp,
Set up as a keyboard shortcut. I use "Visual Studio Code" as a free syntax 
highlighting editor in Linux Mint. 
\
*Gimp->Edit->Keyboard Shortcuts (Refresh Scripts)*

* Keep the Error Console window open. It's the only way I've been able to find
to debug a script.\
*Gimp->Windows->Dockable Dialogues->Error Console*

* Scripts copied from the blog posts should be saved as the same name as the
define name.For example, a script defined as *bareBones* would be saved as
*bareBones.scm* in a scripts folder.

### Quickstart in Script-Fu Plug-Ins - GIMP 2.99.14

* Create a local directory as a sandbox for new plug-ins. Add that directory in
Gimp as a plug-ins folder. 
\
Restart Gimp, any scripts in that new folder should appear as menu items or
useable plug-ins.\
*Gimp->Edit->Preferences->Folders->Plug-Ins (add new folder)*

If it's a plug-in, you don't need to refresh scripts. It updates automatically.
