## Debugging Script-Fu

# * Tested in GIMP 2.99.14 *
  

Here are some debugging techniques using the Script-Fu API function **(gimp-message)** 

To get anywhere with a script I have to write many debug statements that let me know if what I think is happening is actually happening. It's useful to keep all those debug messages in the final script to help future me, or another Script-Fu writer. However seeing _all_ those messages can be annoying when you're working. How can we set up a script so that you can gain more control over those helpful messages?

It's possible to use a function to define a global variable in Script-Fu. This can then be used to decide when particular debug messages will get printed out.
<br>


```scheme
(define debug #t)
```

With this defined in your plugin, you can use an _if true_ statement to control the message activation.


```scheme
(if debug (gimp-message " This is a debug flag controlled message "))
```
Hopefully you can see that it's possible to define more debug flags for extra options.<br>
Another useful technique for pinning down an error is performing a binary search (this half, this quarter, this eighth... ...this line.) with message statements. The following procedure definition provides a shortcut, to help this method.


```scheme
(define (here x)(gimp-message(string-append " >>> " (number->string x) " <<<")))
```
    
Having the line _(here 1)_ in your script would call the above procedure and print out the message;  

```
>>> 1 <<<
```

Because the numbers after the error will not get printed, you can find the problem line with the code.

Sometimes you may want to stop the script. I'm not aware of an elegant way, but it is possible to force a stop with another small function definition.
```scheme
(define (err msg)(gimp-message(string-append " >>> " msg " <<<"))↑read-warning↑)
```
Having the line _(err " the logic was faulty ")_ in your script would call the above procedure and print out the message;  

```

I like to debug using the error console, but you can also switch to debugging in the terminal. The following plugin demonstrates that process and a few other tricks. 



The plug-in should appear in a Fu-Plugin menu.
