## Plug-in example - Plug-in for Gimp 3

Happily, Gimp 3 lets us use Script-fu like a plug-in. This means that each
script can run seperately. These examples show how two scripts can run at the
same time. Install by saving the plug-in folders to a Gimp recognised plug-in 
folder, and then restart Gimp. Also, ensure your error console window is open.
  
* [plug-ins folders](https://github.com/script-fu/script-fu.github.io/blob/main/plug-ins)  
  
* Edit->Preferences->Folders->Plug-ins  
  
* There is no need to refresh plug-ins after editing the script.  
  
* The script file must also be set as an executable in the OS. If it's not the  
  plug-in won't appear. In Linux, new text files are not executable by default.  
  

Once installed as plug-ins, select and run the "helloWorld" menu item, and then
select and run the "helloAgain" menu item.

*Fu-Plug-ins->helloWorld*  

*Fu-Plug-ins->helloAgain*
  
You should see "hello world" and "hello again" printing out in an interleaved
manner to the error console for about 30 seconds.


*a plugin that prints "hello world" 30 times to the error console*

 )
 
 (while (< i 30)
  (gimp-message "hello world")
  (usleep 1000000)
  (set! i (+ i 1))
 )

)
)
