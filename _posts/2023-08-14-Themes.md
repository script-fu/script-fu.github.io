## Themes

# * Tested in GIMP 2.99.19 *

This is not a Script-Fu post, this is about how the GUI appears and how it responds to user input. This is all controlled by a 'theme', which is a CSS file that defines what attributes each element of the interface has. I've put together a few themes for GIMP 3 and I think they're ready to try out. You can see screenshots and download them [here](https://script-fu.github.io/artbox/hub/themes/folder/).

The themes collection includes:

- Default - Mid gray based, using the full tonal range, with a dark and light version
- High Contrast - For easy to see UI features
- Warm - Toasty, with a dark and light version
- Dark - For those who like it darker, with a dark and light version

They can be seen in this [video...](https://youtu.be/G1WA8flcy-0)

These themes have been tested in Linux Mint and Windows 11, at 4k and at 1080p.  
  
Enjoy!
