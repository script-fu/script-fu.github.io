# Installation

Good luck!

* Create a directory as a sandbox for plug-ins. **e.g /home/username/plug-ins/**  
  Add that directory in Gimp as a plug-ins folder, then restart Gimp.
  *Gimp->Edit->Preferences->Folders->Plug-ins*


# Windows OS

When you download a plug-in or script from github it does this as a raw text file.
So a *plugin.scm* can become *plugin.scm.txt*.  This will cause an install fail.
To avoid this, make Windows show file extentions.
  
* Open File Explorer by pressing the Windows key + E.
* Click on the “View” tab at the top of the window.
* Check the “File name extensions” box in the “Show/hide” section of the menu.
  
After you have completed these steps, file extensions will be visible for all
files on your computer.
