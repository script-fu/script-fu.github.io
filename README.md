# Practical examples of using Script-Fu in Gimp.

The procedure browser in Gimp is a great resource.
This repository provides examples of its use, to
help people on the Script-Fu path.

Programmers out there, please forgive my code style, I'm an artist. 
If you see anything that can be achieved in a more elegant way,
without Python, I'd love to know.
